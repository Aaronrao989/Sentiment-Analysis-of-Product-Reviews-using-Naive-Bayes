# Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews using Naive Bayes

## 📌 Project Description

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on Amazon product reviews using the **Naive Bayes** classification algorithm. It classifies customer reviews as either **positive** or **negative**, helping businesses quickly gauge product reception and user satisfaction.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of Amazon product reviews, including textual feedback and their corresponding sentiment labels. It has been preprocessed and cleaned before training.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn
- nltk

## 🚀 Features

- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal)
- Bag-of-Words / TF-IDF vectorization
- Naive Bayes classifier
- Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualization: word clouds, confusion matrix, bar charts

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Load and explore dataset
2. Clean and preprocess the text
3. Convert text to numerical vectors
4. Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
5. Evaluate and visualize model performance
6. Predict sentiment on new/unseen reviews

## 📈 Example Results

| Metric     | Score     |
|------------|-----------|
| Accuracy   | 91.2%     |
| Precision  | 90.4%     |
| Recall     | 89.8%     |
| F1-Score   | 90.1%     |

*Note: Metrics may vary depending on dataset split and parameters.*
